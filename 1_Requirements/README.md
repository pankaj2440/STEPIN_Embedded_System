# Passenger-controlled car seats allow heated by using heater

## Introducation
   
   The vehicle having major feature. In this technology it is used to determine the presence of the passanger and if the passanger existing in side the car then our system starts the functionality.
So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring
and Displaying.


## Used components

* Temperature sensor
* switches
* display
* led for indication
* potential Switch
* resister


## Features
* If the passager in side the car than switch is ON
* Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication
* After the indication it will determine the heat.
* Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
* The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system
* Modular Based Programming

# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities threats

## Strengths

* User Friendly.
* Easy to modify the temperature value
* The system is robust
* Low cost.
* Modular Based Programs

### Weakness

* It's only applicable for the countries which are having having low temperature.

## Opportunities

* It can be implemented by adding heater along with air conditioners so that it will be helpful all the countries.

## Threats

* Not suitable for average or high temperature environment.

# 4W's and 1'H

* WHAT Passanger seat and Heat Monitoring System.
* WHERE Used in automotive industry,
* WHEN At low temperature,
* WHY For being healthy.
* HOW Operates by modifying the temperature,
